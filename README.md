# Reaper JSX Plugins #

This is a collection - at the moment just one - of plugins created for use in Reaper.  

### Pitch To CC ###

Specifically desiged for use with the Arturia Minilab MKII midi keyboard/controller, this plugin converts the pitch wheel to CC controller.  This change fits well with the version 1.1 firmware update for the device that allows the pitch wheel to retain it's position rather than snap back to center.  Converting this to a second modwheel-like controller allows a double-slider type of control where pitch bending isn't needed.  A good example of this situation is with Spitfire Audio instruments where pitch bend is not used, but two sliders are necessary for the two dynamics controllers, making this an ideal setup for playing Spitfire instruments 'live'.

The only parameter is a slider for changing the CC signal.  By default this is set to 3, but it can be manually set to accomodate any learned CC setup.
